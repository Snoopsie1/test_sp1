<h2>1.1 Shooting</h2>
*"A woman fired a shot at a man with her gun, but the man did not die. List the possible
reasons for the man not dying."*
1. The woman missed the target
2. The firearm isn't lethal
3. Bullet deflection
4. The man wears a bulletproof vest
5. Medical intervention, if someone could intervene and medically help the man persist through a fatal injury.
<h2>1.2</h2>
_"An alien meets you and it asks you to teach it how to brush its teeth. Assume that the
alien has teeth exactly like yours, and is as smart as you, but it needs a clear step-bystep instruction. List the steps. Be as detailed as you can. (Example: Hold the
toothpaste with your left hand; turn the cap
anti-clockwise)"_

Step 1: Grab a toothbrush in one hand
Step 2: With your empty hand, turn on the cold water in your sink
Step 3: Rinse the toothbrush-hairs with cold water
Step 4: With your empty hand, turn off the cold water in your sink
Step 5: With your empty hand, grab some toothpaste
Step 6: Flip the cap off (Assuming it's a flip-cap)
Step 7: Point the nuzzle of the toothpaste towards the hairs of your toothbrush
Step 8: Squeeze the toothpaste gently, until the tips of the toothbrush-hairs are covered with toothpaste
Step 9: Flip the toothpaste cap on
Step 10: Place the toothpaste back where you found it
Step 11: With your toothbrush in one hand and your other hand empty. Open your mouth, and choose a side to place the toothbrush on your teeth, where the toothbrush hairs, touch your teeth.
Step 12: Move your toothbrush back and forth ensuring you get the entire row of teeth. 
Step 12a: Don't forget to brush the inner-side of your teeth.
Step 13: Once you've done that for a while move the tooth-brush up/down to the row of teeth you haven't brushed.
Step 14: Once you've finished the side you've chosen, both upper and lower row of teeth. Swap to the other side that you need to brush.
Step 15: Repeat step 12, 12a & step 13
Step 16: Once you're done with that side, face the toothbrush hairs towards your front teeth, and start brushing them.
Step 17: Once you're done with that, with your empty hand, turn on the cold water in your sink
Step 18: Tilt your head so that your mouth align with the running water under you sink
Step 19: Lean your head towards the sink, making sure that your mouth gets the running water into your mouth.
Step 20: Fill your mouth with water, once your mouth is full of water, lean a little back and spit the water out.
Step 21: Stand back up
Step 22: Rinse your toothbrush with the cold water, getting rid of the rest of the toothpaste
Step 23: Turn off the water in your sink with your empty hand.
Step 24: Place the toothbrush back where you found it.
Step 25: You are done C:

<h3>3. Give your thoughts</h3>

<h2>Q: _What was positive and good about using TDD?_</h2>

A: 
Improved Code Quality: By encouraging to writing tests first, which leads to more reliable and maintainable code.

Early Issue Detection: It helps catch bugs and issues early in the development process, reducing the cost of fixing them later.

Clear Requirements: Forces us to define clear requirements and specifications for their code.

Documentation: Tests serve as documentation and examples of how code should be used.

Confidence: We gain confidence in our code's correctness because it's continuously tested.

Refactoring Safety: Makes it safer to refactor code, knowing that tests will catch regressions.

Collaboration: It fosters collaboration by providing a clear understanding of code behavior.

Productivity: In the long run, it can lead to faster development and fewer defects.

<h2>Q: _What was annoying or difficult?_</h2>

A:
Initial Learning Curve: It may be challenging to adopt initially, as it requires a mindset shift and learning new practices.

Time-Consuming: Writing tests before code can be time-consuming, especially for complex systems.

Maintenance Overhead: Maintaining a large suite of tests can be cumbersome and time-intensive.

Resistance: Some team members may resist to this development-style due to the perceived added workload.

Test Dependency: Tests can become overly dependent on implementation details, making refactoring harder.

Incomplete Coverage: Achieving complete test coverage can be difficult, leading to potential blind spots.

Continuous Discipline: Staying disciplined in writing tests for every piece of code can be challenging.

<h2>Q: _What surprised you?_</h2>

A: It feels like _double-work_. However it helps me be more confident with the code that I have produced

<h2>Q: _Did TDD help you write some tests you wouldnâ€™t otherwise have thought of?_</h2>

A: It helped me write tests for what would be unthinkable inputs. Like I would never in a million years think about how a function that takes 2 numbers, and add them together, would react to non-number inputs. Or the same with Roman numeral convert. And how it would react to non-roman-numeral inputs
